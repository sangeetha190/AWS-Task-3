### S3 Bucket with CloudWatch Logging - Step-by-Step Guide
#### Task Breakdown & Completion Status:
- Step 1: Created an S3 bucket with no public access.
- Step 2: Uploaded files to the private S3 bucket.
- Step 3: Enabled CloudTrail to track S3 activities.

#### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket (Private)
      - Log in to AWS Console → Navigate to S3.
      - Click "Create bucket".
      - Enter a Bucket Name (sangeethacloud-my-private-bucket).
      - Choose a Region (same as your AWS resources).
      - Block all public access →  Enable (this ensures the bucket remains private).

#### Step 3: Enable CloudTrail to Log S3 File Activities
To track uploads, downloads, and deletions, we need to enable CloudTrail.

      - Enter Trail Name: s3-logging-trail.
      - Storage Location:
           - Select "Use existing S3 bucket" and choose sangeethacloud-my-private-bucket 
           - This will store CloudTrail logs inside your bucket.
- create the tail

### Task 1 is Done.
==================================================================================================================================
## Task 2 
📌 Step 1: Launch Two EC2 Instances
We need two servers (EC2 instances) that will run behind the Load Balancer.

#### Create EC2 Instance 1 (web-server-1)
       - Go to AWS Console → Search "EC2" → Click "Instances".
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cead4134-abbc-425e-97cf-508d05768dfc)

       - Choose Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
            - Select Amazon Linux 2 (or Ubuntu if you prefer).
       - Choose Instance Type:
           - Select t2.micro (Free Tier eligible).
       - Key Pair:
           - Select an existing key pair or create a new one (Save the private key .pem file).
       - Network Settings:
           - Choose "Default VPC" or create a new VPC (default is fine).
           - Select "Public Subnet" (so we can access it).
           - Enable Auto-Assign Public IP.
       - Security Group:
          - Create a new security group:
          - Allow SSH (port 22) (for connecting to the instance).
          - Allow HTTP (port 80) (to allow web traffic).
       - Add User Data (This script will set up a web server automatically):
          - Click Advanced details → User Data → Paste this script:
                 - #!/bin/bash
                 - yum update -y
                 - yum install -y httpd
                 - echo "<h1>Welcome to Web Server 1</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
                 - systemctl start httpd
                 - systemctl enable httpd
                 - Click "Launch Instance".
         - ✅ Instance 1 (web-server-1) is now running! 🎉
