      - Enter Trail Name: s3-logging-trail.
      - Storage Location:
           - Select "Use existing S3 bucket" and choose sangeethacloud-my-private-bucket 
           - This will store CloudTrail logs inside your bucket.
- create the tail

### Task 1 is Done.
===================================================================================================
## Task 2 
### ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Launch Two EC2 Instances
   - We need two servers (EC2 instances) that will run behind the Load Balancer.
  - Navigate to AWS EC2 Console..
  - Choose Amazon Linux 2 as the AMI.
  - Select t2.micro instance type.
  - Configure instance details and ensure both instances are in the same VPC.
  - Add User Data to install a web server:
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baeadc62-0a7b-4136-9bcb-31e919712810)
  - Repeat the process for the second instance, but modify the HTML content:

  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43bfa57-d545-4f4c-8853-ffec73e46460)
  - Configure Security Group:
  - Allow HTTP (Port 80) from Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
  - Allow SSH (Port 22) from Your IP.
  - Launch the Instances and note their Public IPs.

##  Testing the Load Balancer
  - Wait for the ALB status to become Active.
  - Open the Load Balancer DNS Name in a browser.
  
      - [Scheme: Internet-facing.](http://web-alb-xxxxxx.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com/)
      
 - Expected Output:
      - Welcome to Web Server 1
      - Welcome to Web Server 2
## (Load Balancer is distributing traffic between both servers)

ðŸŽ¯ Final Confirmation
- âœ… Web Servers are running
- âœ… Load Balancer is distributing traffic
- âœ… DNS is accessible and responding correctly
